# Apex Legend Chooser

My randomizer turned into an Android app! Contains (almost) everything from the [React version](https://github.com/Yoshiboi18303/apex-mini-randomizer)!

## I don't have an Android device, can I use it on iOS?

No. I do not at all have a Mac, so I can't build for iOS. Sorry guys.

## I don't have an Android device, can I use it on Windows?

Sadly, no. I did not target Windows for this, and it looks ugly on Windows compared to Android.

## Installation

Not done yet, so no download link yet.
